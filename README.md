ðŸ§  Disease Prediction App
A Machine Learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of three major health conditions: Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, Heart Disease, and Diabetes. Built as part of the AICTE Virtual Internship Program in collaboration with the Edunet Foundation.
ðŸš€ Project Overview
This application allows users to input medical data and receive real-time predictions using pre-trained ML models. The aim is to assist in early detection and support medical professionals in preliminary screening.
ðŸ©º Features
Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Prediction using voice measurement features.


Heart Disease Prediction based on clinical parameters like blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.


Diabetes Prediction using health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, and age.


Clean, user-friendly interface for input and prediction.


Model performance validated using standard evaluation metrics.


ðŸ§  Technologies Used
Frontend: Streamlit (for building interactive web interface)


Backend: Python


ML Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy


Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM (model per disease optimized separately)


ðŸ§ª Datasets
Parkinsonâ€™s: UCI ML Parkinsonâ€™s Dataset


Heart Disease: UCI Heart Disease Dataset


Diabetes: PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset
